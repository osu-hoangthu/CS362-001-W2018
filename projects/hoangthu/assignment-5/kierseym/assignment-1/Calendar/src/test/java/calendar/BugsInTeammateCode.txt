While testing your code, I found two bugs in two different classes.
The first bug I found was in the class Appt.java in the method isValid() on line 122. In this method, if the variable startMinute is valid, then
    start minute will be incremented by 2. By doing so, the incorrect startMinute will be saved for all of the user's appointments.
    I would advise to not increment startMinute at all. This could possibly also cause startMinute to not be valid if it's originally set
    to anything higher than 58.

The second bug I found was in the class TimeTable.java in the method getApptRange() on line 36. With this bug, it causes a throw error while
    retrieving the appointments. Because of the error, the app is unable to be used properly. I would advise to change the conditional by simply
    negating the conditional instead of checking for the conditional. By doing so, it would allow the behavior of the Calendar app to retrieve the
    saved appointments correctly.
